Playing around with votings statistics from the 2016 US presidential eleciton.

The electoral college makes everyone focus on "red states" and "blue states", but I was curious what patterns emerged at the county level. Specifically, I wanted to test the urban-rural divide narrative by seeing how the population of a county correlated to voting patterns. (Data sources are attriburted in the code)
